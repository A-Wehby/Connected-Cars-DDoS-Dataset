# Connected-Cars-DDoS-Dataset

## Contents
The dataset contains the Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) as received by the Road Site Units. The contents of the messages contain the default fields of the ETSI standard [302 637-2] and no optional fields are included. This gives a total of 26 features related to the CAM. In addition, simulation time and the data label are included making a dataset of 28 columns.
